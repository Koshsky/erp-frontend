# AGENTS.md

Frontend service of the MVS ERP monorepo (repo root is `../..`, sibling `services/backend` is the Go API serving `/api/v1`). Stack: Vue 3 (`<script setup>`) + TypeScript + Vite + Pinia + Vue Router, component-driven with Storybook.

## Language rule (mandatory)

- Code comments, documentation, and commit messages are written in **English only**.
- The UI is **bilingual (Russian + English)**. Russian is the source of truth
  and the fallback, English is the translation. User-facing strings never live
  inline in components: they live in the catalogs `src/i18n/locales/ru/*` and
  `src/i18n/locales/en/*` (split by domain) and are read with `t()` from
  `src/i18n` — the active locale follows the `uiLanguage` setting.
- Adding or changing a visible string means updating **both** catalogs in the
  same commit; `src/i18n/locales.test.ts` enforces key parity (mirrored by
  `AGENTS.md` rule checks). The gate `src/i18n/hardcodedText.test.ts` fails on
  Russian text left inline in a component, a template node or an attribute
  value; the documented escapes are the catalogs, the `i18n-allow` line marker
  (own-language names, dev-console logs, internal Error texts, each with a
  reason) and the functional data allowlist in the test.
- Text that must re-render on a language switch is computed inside a function /
  `computed` — module-level `t()` snapshots and materialized view models freeze
  the language (use `appLocale` from `src/i18n` for a reactive dependency).
- Dates and numbers go through `src/i18n/date.ts` (Intl per locale), never
  through a hardcoded `'ru'`/`'ru-RU'` locale.
- Server-stored data (user, project, process, task, comment, preset and state
  names) is not translated.
- **Deliberate exception — changelogs are split per language**: `Changelog_ENG.md` (English) and `Changelog_RU.md` (Russian), see the Changelog section below.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` runs **Storybook** (port 6006) — not the app. `npm start` runs the Vite dev server (port 5173); `npm run stop` kills it.
- The Vite dev server caches SFC transforms and, after edits, can serve a **torn module** (fresh `<script setup>` + an old render function). Symptom: a setting changes in the store but the UI does not react, while the file on disk, the type check and the story tests are all fine. Fix: restart the server (`npm run stop && npm start`); a quick alternative is `touch` on the edited file plus a page reload. To see what the server actually returns, check the render condition, e.g. `curl -s 'http://127.0.0.1:5173/src/<path>.vue' | grep -n 'tb-comments' -B3` — it must reference the current bindings.
- There is **no `npm test`**. Vitest tests run through Storybook's `@storybook/addon-vitest` (`.stories.ts` files).
- Stories take their assertions from `storybook/test` (`import { expect } from 'storybook/test'`), **never from `vitest`**: a story also renders in the `storybook dev` canvas, where vitest's `expect` throws at import time and the story fails with "The component failed to render properly". ESLint enforces this (`no-restricted-imports`/`no-restricted-syntax` for `src/**/*.stories.ts`).
- `npm run check` (alias `typecheck`) = `vue-tsc --noEmit` — the type gate, run after edits.
- `npm run lint` = `eslint src --max-warnings 0` — the lint gate (flat config in `eslint.config.js`; generated `src/api` is excluded), run after edits; **0 problems required**.
- `npm run build` = `vite build` → `dist/`.

## Changelog
- When a user-facing change lands, add a **brief, laconic, one-line bullet** (no long descriptions, no examples) under `## [Unreleased]` in BOTH `Changelog_ENG.md` (English) and `Changelog_RU.md` (Russian) in the same commit (see root `AGENTS.md` → Changelog (between releases)).
- **Notable changes only**: cosmetic polish (spacing, sizes, row or card layout, tab order, hint and label texts) gets no bullet — fold it into the bullet of the feature it belongs to, or skip it. The criteria and examples live in the root `AGENTS.md`.

## Desktop releases — always via `desktop/build-portable.sh`
- Produce desktop artifacts **only** through `desktop/build-portable.sh` from
  `desktop/`. It always rebuilds `dist/` from sources (deletes `dist/`, purges
  the vite caches) and verifies the result, because the Electron wrapper embeds
  `dist/` into the release as `resources/web` (`extraResources` in
  `desktop/package.json`).
- Versioning: web and desktop share ONE version — the single source of truth
  is this service's `package.json`; `build-portable.sh` always builds that
  version as is (it never bumps) and syncs `desktop/package.json` (+ its
  lockfile) to the same value automatically.
- **Never** run `electron-builder` / `npm run dist*` by hand against a
  pre-existing `dist/`: a stale `dist/` gets embedded into a newly versioned
  release, so the app shows old UI (removed pages still visible) while its
  version says otherwise. `--build-web` is a deprecated no-op — the web build is
  unconditional.
- Diagnosing "the packaged app shows old UI": read
  `desktop/release/<version>/<app>-unpacked/resources/web/precache-manifest.json`
  — `version` must equal the release version. A git-hash value
  (e.g. `1808c37-mtx0hk8x`) means a stale bundle was embedded.

## `src/api/` is generated — do not hand-edit
- Generated by OpenAPI Generator v7.24.0 (see `openapitools.json`) from `../../services/backend/docs/swagger/swagger.yaml`. After the backend contract changes, regenerate the client; manual edits to `src/api/*.ts` are lost on regeneration (respect `.openapi-generator-ignore`).

## Environment
- Copy `.env.example` → `.env`. `VITE_API_URL` (default `/api/v1`) is the API base passed to the client via `Configuration` in `src/store/index.ts`.
- **The web build MUST be same-origin** (nginx proxy or the vite `/api` dev proxy): the HttpOnly refresh cookie (`mvs_refresh`, Path=`/api/v1/auth`) does not survive a cross-origin API base — `/auth/refresh` would always 401 and the user would be logged out on every access-token expiry. Do not point `VITE_API_URL` at an absolute cross-origin URL in the web build.
- `VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET` (default `http://localhost:8080`) is the dev proxy target for `/api` (vite.config.ts).
- Docker build bakes `VITE_API_BASE` in as a build-arg (Dockerfile); `.env` is gitignored.

## Architecture rules (repo conventions, keep them)
- API calls are allowed **only** in `views/`, `composables/`, and `store/`. Components under `src/components/` must never import `@/api` or fetch; they receive data via props/emit or read Pinia. Views load via stores and pass down props (see `views/PlannerPage.vue`).
- Backend always returns `{ data, error }`; unwrap the payload via `data` and never read other top-level fields. `data` is an object/list container, not a bare array.
- Auth: JWT tokens + user cached in localStorage keys `mvs_erp_*`; the router guard redirects unauthenticated users to `/login` (add `meta: { requiresAuth: true }` on protected routes).

## Component conventions
- Each component dir ships `X.vue` + `types.ts` + `argTypes.ts` + `X.stories.ts` + `index.ts` (barrel re-export, aggregated in `src/components/planner/index.ts`).
- Storybook exposes global `theme` (default/compact/minimal) and `scheme` (light/dark) toolbars via decorators in `.storybook/decorators/`; new components/stories must work in all combos.
- Gantt positioning uses cell offsets from an `anchor` reference for a `mode` (`quarter`/`half`/`year` = number of calendar months from the anchor's month) and a `unit` (`day`/`decade`). Decade cells are aligned to calendar months (1–10, 11–20, 21–end); the first decade of the anchor month is partial (starts at the anchor). Keep date math in `src/components/planner/calendar.ts`, not the store.

## Running the full stack
- `docker-compose.yml` here runs the frontend alone (port 3000). The full stack (nginx → frontend + Go `erp` + postgres + flyway) is in `../../docker-compose.yml`.
