/**
 * Non-volatile refresh-token store (IndexedDB), shared by the web build and
 * the desktop (Electron) build.
 *
 * The refresh token is the single "remember me" mechanism, replacing the
 * desktop auto-sync password (safeStorage) that was removed. The token
 * returned by /auth/login and /auth/refresh is saved here in all
 * environments and sent in the body of /auth/refresh for silent session
 * renewal; the HttpOnly cookie stays only as a legacy web fallback.
 *
 * The token is kept indefinitely — no TTL (see the no-TTL invariant in
 * db.ts): the refresh session itself expires server-side (168 h). The store is
 * written on every login/refresh rotation and cleared on logout.
